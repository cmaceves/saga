# Saga

Tool for building consensus sequences from complex viral mixtures.

### Methods

### SAGA



## Novelty
1. Returns ideal threshold for consensus calling
2. Returns rough estimate of number of things in sample
3. Determines whether consensus can be called
4. Calls consensus on sub-majority populations if possible

## Input
1. ivar variants file generated with depth set to 0

## Figures
1. a. Workflow
   b. Spike-in data
     1. Predicted r vs. actual r value
     2. Predicted centers vs. ground truth scatter plot
